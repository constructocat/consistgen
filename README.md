# A demo project to showcase GitHub Artifact Attestations

> Artifact attestations enable you to create unfalsifiable provenance and integrity guarantees for the software you build. In turn, people who consume your software can verify where and how your software was built. This demo project showcases how to use GitHub Artifact Attestation to sign and verify artifacts for a Maven project.
